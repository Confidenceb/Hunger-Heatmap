# 🍽 Hunger HeatMap

**Hunger HeatMap** is a crowdsourced, data-driven platform that visualizes areas affected by food scarcity and hunger in real time — helping NGOs, volunteers, and government agencies respond faster and smarter.

### 🌍 **Overview**

Across many communities, hunger remains invisible until it becomes a crisis. Hunger HeatMap aims to change that by providing a **real-time, map-based view of hunger incidents**.

Users can report areas facing food scarcity, and these reports are aggregated to generate a **heatmap** that highlights critical hunger zones. This allows organizations and individuals to **target their interventions more effectively**.


### ✨ **Key Features**

* 📍 **Crowdsourced Hunger Reports** — Anyone can report hunger incidents anonymously.
* 🗺 **Interactive Heatmap** — Color intensity reflects hunger severity (e.g., red = severe).
* 🧭 **Real-Time Updates** — See emerging hunger hotspots as data comes in.
* 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 **Aid Coordination** — NGOs and volunteers can discover urgent zones and plan responses.
* 📊 **Data Filtering** — Filter by severity, region, or time period.
* 🔔 **(Optional)** SMS reporting for communities with poor internet access.


### 🧠 **Why It's Unique**

Unlike typical hunger awareness apps, **Hunger HeatMap focuses on actionable, real-time visualization** rather than just storytelling.
Think of it as a **“Google Maps for hunger emergencies.”**
